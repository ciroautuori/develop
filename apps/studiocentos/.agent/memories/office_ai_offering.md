# Office AI & Digital Workspace Service

## Core Philosophy
We believe that **Developer Tools** (IDEs, Version Control, Advanced LLM interfaces) are the most powerful productivity instruments ever created, and they shouldn't be limited to programmers.
We "skin" these tools and configure them for other professionals (Lawyers, Accountants, Creatives), creating a **Tailor-Made Digital Office**.

## The Offering
1.  **Analysis**: We study the client's actual workflow (what documents they read, what email they write, repetitive tasks).
2.  **Architecture**: We don't just "install apps". We build an ecosystem.
3.  **Setup**: Configuration of specific tools:
    - **NotebookLM** (Google): For RAG on private documents (Contracts, Laws).
    - **Cursor / VS Code**: Configured as a "Document Editor on Steroids" with Copilot/AI.
    - **Gemini / AI Studio**: For multimodal analysis.
    - **Claude / Manus**: For complex reasoning.
4.  **Training (Strategic)**: We teach *how* to think with AI. Prompting as a dialogue, not a command.

## Key Differentiation
- **"Tailor-Made"**: Not a generic SaaS subscription. It's a consulting service.
- **"Developer Grade"**: We give you the same power devs have.
- **"Education"**: We don't fish for you; we teach you to use the fishing rod (the IDE).

## Target Audience
- Lawyers (Contract analysis)
- Accountants (Data processing)
- Researchers/Academics (Paper analysis)
- High-level Executives (Strategic synthesis)
